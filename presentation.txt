# Objectives

1. Flip between conda environments in notebooks
2. One-line terminal command jupyter lab on amarel compute node

# About conda

* Installing anaconda/miniconda gives you access to the `conda` package manager (GUI/terminal)
* Use the more complete `conda-forge` channel to install packages

After installing anaconda/miniconda run:
```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict 
```

Look at packages and environment:
```bash
conda list  # shows installed packages in your current environment
conda env list # shows your environments
```

# Installing conda environments

## Command line

```bash
conda create -n testenv -c conda-forge python=3.10
    ipykernel numpy matplotlib
```

## Using a `yaml` file e.g.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

```
name: testenv
channels:
- conda-forge
- defaults
dependencies:
- python=3.*
- ipykernel
- numpy
- matplotlib
```

# Managing conda environments

## Change environment with:

```bash
conda activate [environment]
```
Then you can run packages and scripts. 

## Deactivate:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Remove with:

```bash
conda remove --name testenv --all
```

# Conda environments summary

* Conda environments are just collections of software packages (typically python packages, but could be anything - i.e. `wget`) 
* Can consider environments like isolated python installations. [`octant`](https://github.com/hetland/octant) is a great example why this is useful. It needed python version 2.7 so is incompatible with newer packages (e.g. `xarray`) that use python 3. 

# Kernels

Kernels are running instances of your conda environments. Notebooks can be set to use specific kernels. 

## Install
```bash
conda activate testenv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name testenv
```

(This is why you need to install the `ipykernel` package)

# Managing kernels

For this you need the `jupyter` package which can be installed in the base (default) environment. 

## List
```bash
conda activate base
jupyter kernelspec list
```

## Remove

```bash
jupyter kernelspec remove testenv
```

# Making use of kernels in notebooks

Drop down box on the right hand side.

# Summary workflow

* Exploring a python research project e.g.:

[https://github.com/jessecusack/example_research_project](https://github.com/jessecusack/example_research_project)

1. Clone/download the github repo
1. Install/create the conda environment
1. Install the kernel for the environment
1. Run the analysis in jupyter lab

# Amarel

Que: login

There are two conda installations accessible via community and DMCS packages.

Add to `.bashrc`:
```
module use /projects/dmcs_1/sw/modulefiles/Core
module use /projects/community/modulefiles
module load xroms
# OR module load anaconda
```

# Install miniconda on Amarel (for reference)

This is really easy and gives you full control. 

```bash
ssh amarel
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

You could still use xroms afterwards via a kernel. 

```bash
conda deactivate # to deactivate your own version
conda load xroms
python -m ipykernel install --user --name xroms
```

Then remove `module load xroms` from your `.bashrc`.

# Running jupyter lab remotely

## Method 1 - manually 

### On Amarel:
```bash
tmux  # OR screen
srun --partition=main -n 1 --mem=8G --time=00:30:00 
    --pty bash
echo $(hostname)
jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8897 --ip="$(hostname)"
# I have `module load xroms` in my `.bashrc` for 
# this to work
```

**Copy the token and note the hostname!** Then hit `ctrl+b, d` to disconnect from tmux. Run `tmux a` to reconnect. 

# Running jupyter lab remotely

### On my laptop:
```bash
ssh -L 8897:[hostname]:8897 -N amarel
# hostname e.g. slepner010
```
Then put `localhost:8897 in your browser. You'll need to paste the token or create a password using: 

```bash
jupyter server password
```

This method is robust to disconnections! Simply run the above `ssh` command again and refresh your browser. 

# Running jupyter lab remotely

## Method 2 - jupyter-forward

On your laptop install jupyter-forward e.g. 

```bash
conda activate base
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-forward
```

### Run the (long) one-liner:

* You must have some version of `conda` **WITH** `jupyter lab` available on Amarel, either your own installation, xroms (put `module load xroms` in your `.bashrc`) or the other anaconda distribution (put `module load anaconda` in your `.bashrc`). 

```bash
jupyter-forward --port=8898 --launch-command="srun 
    --partition=main --mem=8G --time=00:30:00" 
    [username]@amarel.rutgers.edu
```

# Remote jupyter lab summary

* Rapidly test code on compute nodes with little overhead.
* Access full jupyter lab environment.
* With your own installation you can customise everything (with jupyter lab extensions).
* Use environments and kernels for different package configurations.
